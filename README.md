### **Live Demo üöÄ: [https://www.yt2clip.live](https://www.yt2clip.live)**

---

`yt2clip.live` is a full-stack web application designed to provide a seamless experience for creating video clips or extracting audio from YouTube videos. It leverages a powerful, asynchronous backend to process video streams on-the-fly without needing to download the entire video first.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **On-the-Fly Processing:** Utilizes a stream-based approach with `ffmpeg`, ensuring fast processing times even for long videos.
- **Dual Mode Functionality:**
  - **Clip Video:** Cut precise segments from videos with an interactive timeline.
  - **Download Audio:** Convert and download the full audio track of any video.
- **Interactive UI:** A sleek, responsive interface built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, featuring a draggable timeline slider for millisecond-precision.
- **Multiple Formats:** Supports various output formats including MP4, MOV for video and MP3, WAV, OGG for audio.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Employs WebSockets to provide live updates on job progress, from queueing to completion.
- **Secure & Robust:** Built with modern security best practices, including rate limiting, input validation, secure headers (CSP), and an automated cookie renewal system.
- **Analytics & Logging:** Tracks anonymous usage data for feature analysis and logs all processing jobs to a PostgreSQL database for monitoring.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works (Architecture)

The application is built on a decoupled **microservices architecture** to handle requests asynchronously and efficiently.

1.  The **Next.js Frontend**, hosted on Vercel, sends a job request to the Spring Boot API.
2.  The **Spring Boot API** acts as the orchestrator. It validates the request, manages the user's WebSocket session, and places a job onto a **Redis** queue.
3.  The **Python Worker** (running in a Docker container) is a powerful processing engine. It picks up the job from the queue, uses `yt-dlp` to fetch the video stream URL (with auto-renewed cookies via Selenium), and processes it with `ffmpeg`.
4.  Upon completion (or failure), the worker logs the outcome to a **PostgreSQL** database (hosted on Neon.tech) and publishes a result message to a **Redis Pub/Sub** channel.
5.  The **Spring Boot API**, listening to the channel, receives the result and pushes a real-time notification to the correct user's browser via **WebSockets**.
6.  The entire infrastructure is protected and accelerated by **Cloudflare**, which provides DNS, SSL, and security services.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vercel Analytics
- **Backend API:** Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Web, WebSockets
- **Backend Worker:** Python, Selenium, `yt-dlp`, `ffmpeg-python`, `psycopg2`
- **Infrastructure & DevOps:** Docker, Docker Compose, Redis, PostgreSQL (Neon.tech), Nginx (as Reverse Proxy), Cloudflare, DigitalOcean, Vercel

## üé¨ Usage

1.  Visit **[https://www.yt2clip.live](https://www.yt2clip.live)**.
2.  Paste a non-DRM protected YouTube URL into the input field.
3.  Wait for the video information to load.
4.  Select your desired mode: 'Clip Video' or 'Download Audio'.
5.  Adjust the settings (format, quality, and time range for clips).
6.  Click 'Create' and watch the real-time status updates.
7.  Download your file once the job is complete!
